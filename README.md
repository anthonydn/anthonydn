### Anthony Darrouzet-Nardi

I'm an ecosystem ecologist working at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). I study belowground processes in drylands and teach reproducible analysis in R, data QC, and scientific visualization. This page links to R packages, analysis scripts tied to papers, and selected teaching materials.
